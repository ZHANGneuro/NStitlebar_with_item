Customised NStitleBar for MacOS<br /><br />
![alt tag](https://github.com/ZHANGneuro/NStitlebar_with_item/blob/master/screenshot.png)
<br /><br />
This tiny project is an example to show how to:<br />

1) change the height of NStitleBar without using a NStoolbar,<br />
2) vertically centering traffic light,<br />
3) add and vertically centering NSbutton on NStitleBar.<br />

This work are mainly based on previous works including:<br /><br />
[INAppStoreWindow](https://github.com/indragiek/INAppStoreWindow/blob/master/README.md) by [@indragiek](https://github.com/indragiek)<br />
[WAYWindow](https://github.com/weAreYeah/WAYWindow/blob/master/README.md) by [@We are Yeah!](https://github.com/weAreYeah)<br />
MANY THANKS!!!<br />
These might be helpful if you want to build an app with a same style with 'Notes' and 'Safari'. <br /><br /><br />
