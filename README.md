# NStitlebar_with_item
Customised NStitleBar for MacOS


This tiny project is an example to show how to:

1) change the height of NStitleBar,
2) vertically centering traffic light,
3) add and vertically centering NSbutton on NStitleBar.

This work are mainly based on previous works including INAppStoreWindow & WAYWindow, MANY THANKS to @We are Yeah! & @indragie.
