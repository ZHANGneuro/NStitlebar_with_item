# NStitlebar_with_item<br />
Customised NStitleBar for MacOS


This tiny project is an example to show how to:<br />

1) change the height of NStitleBar,<br />
2) vertically centering traffic light,<br />
3) add and vertically centering NSbutton on NStitleBar.<br />

This work are mainly based on previous works including:
